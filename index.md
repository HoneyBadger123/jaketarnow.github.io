I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/computer-science). I am also a full-time Associate Developer at [Acxiom](http://www.acxiom.com/), now aquired by [Zeta Interactive](http://www.zetainteractive.com/).
