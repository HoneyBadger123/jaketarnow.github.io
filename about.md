I am currently pursuing my Master's Degree in Computer Science at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/computer-science). I am also a full-time Associate Developer at [Zeta Global](http://zetaglobal.com/), which aquired [Acxiom](http://www.acxiom.com/).
