		<h3>Blockchain DAPP (Sponsored by AT&T)</h3>
		<p>The background of this project is based on the scenario where companies want to do background checking for a particular candidate. There are many organizations providing such service but they come at a cost. The verification process becomes very costly as companies have to go through this process for each candidate. To solve this problem and save companies money, we introduce the idea of digitalising candidates’ identity by saving them in a distributed system. The project will be mainly focusing on three actors: students (candidates seeking jobs), registrars(schools) and recruiters. An Android app will be provided for students to create, edit and read their own identities, which will be stored in the blockchain system. A web app will be provided for both registrars and recruiters, allowing them to authenticate a student’s identity or verify a student’s identity. Students also need to authorize companies for verification challenge. As the number of verification challenges increase over time for a specific actor, the stronger their authenticity of identity.</p>

		<h3>Computer Networking (Directed Study with Sami Rollins)</h3>
		<p>Objective is to build an application that can decode all devices found on your wifi network and run diagnostics on their consumption of the network. Options include running a speed tests that will display (ping, download, and upload) speeds. With regards to the devices, there will be MAC Address decoding to see the human readable names of the devices such as "John's MacBook Pro".</p>
		<p>The tasks that I created were:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>Find all devices on wifi. Display network address, name of device, and manufacturer (Decoding MAC Address)</li>
			<li>Scan active services such as HTTP, SMS, FTP, DNS</li>
			<li>Identify the hops to reach a specific destination. Important to follow where the packets go</li>
			<li>Meause network performance. Basic speed test of the network. Measure the round-trip for packets sent to a destination host. Testing of ping, download, and upload. </li>
			<li>With all of the above in mind, diagnose the network and how it runs throughout the day and common devices that are on the network...(time frame per device, how much usage it is conducting, how the various devices interact with each other)</li>
			<li>Possibly suggest ways to optimize your home network</li>
		</ul>

		<h3>Intrusion Detector (Data Mining/Machine Learning Project)</h3>
		<p>Gathered from the KDD Cup Data Set, the features outlined by Stolfo, defined features that help in distinguishing normal connections from bad connection, i.e. attacks. They categorized the features into the following: same host, same service, time-based traffic, host-based traffic, and content features. Same host features examine only connections in the past two seconds. These features have the same destination host as the current connections. Same service features examine connections that have the same service as the current connection in the past two seconds. Both of these together, same host and same service, are defined as time-based traffic. Host-based traffic on the other hand, involves sorting connection records by destination host. Thus, focusing on the same host instead of a specific time window. Finally, content features are added features that help in determining other predictors that may add to certain behaviors in the data.</p>
