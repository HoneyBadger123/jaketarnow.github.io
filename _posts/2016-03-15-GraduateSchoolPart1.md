It has been a couple months already in my second semester of graduate school and things have definitely picked up. Last semester we had two classes and a seminar. The classes were: Principles of Software Development, Graduate Algorithms, and Research Seminar (Data Visualization).

Now, prior to grad school I had only worked primarily in scripting languages and markdown languages such as: HTML5, JavaScript, SQL, CSS3, and php.  I had never formally learned a statically typed programming language such as Java or C. Yet, before school started I taught myself Java, C, and took a class at San Francisco State to ramp up on my math, data structures and algorithms.  

As the first semester of graduate school unfolded at USF, we focused on software development through concurrency, networking, Web, HTTP, and distributed topics. Through our labs we ventured through various data structures, concurrency and multithreaded programming, web clients via both a screen scraper and a web service client, and finally building our own HTTP Server.  All of these labs and the final project of the class were using Java, Jetty, and some Python for testing as well.  The final project was to build a fully functional website from the ground up. The goal was to build a “Yelp” like website with additional features that we could propose. The project was a blast and really opened my eyes to all that goes into a fully functional website via a SOA and utilizing various API’s. 

Checkout my final project here as I have it hosted via an AWS instance: [Yap!](http://ec2-54-213-5-159.us-west-2.compute.amazonaws.com:9050/yap)

Our second main class last semester was Graduate Algorithms. This class was probably one of the hardest classes I have had. The learning objective for the class was that upon successful completion of the course, you should be able to analyze the running time and space requirements for complex algorithms, both recursive and iterative. One will understand a variety of fundamental computer science algorithms, and be able to modify them to solve related problems. Most importantly, one will improve their “algorithmic thinking” skills, and be better able to create novel algorithms for new problems. I believe 110% that all of these objectives were achieved through this course. We started out with some review and recurrence relations, then moving through each type of algorithm: Randomized, Sorting, Selection, Modifying Data Structures, Dynamic Programming, Greedy Algorithms, Amortized Analysis, Graphs, and String Matching with some RSA Encryption. It was a great class and we learned so much through the semester. Plus it was great writing a ton of pseudo code to get our minds thinking.
