In progress...
<!--As most of us may have noticed there was a pretty well broadcasted vulnerability a week or so ago known as WannaCry. WannaCry originated from a massive ransomware attack using the EternalBlue exploit.
EternalBlue, which was originally exposed on April 14th via the Shadow Brokers dump of the NSA hacking tools, leverages a vulnerability known as [MS17-010](https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/security/ms17-010.aspx). 

The vulnearability is in Microsoft Server Message Block (SMB) and uses TCP port 445 to discover vulnerable computers on a network and spread malicious payloads of the attacker's choice across the network. The attack used an NSA backdoor called DoublePulsar.
While this was infecting computers, there was another attack utilizing both EternalBlue and DoublePulsar to install the cryptocurreny miner Adylkuzz. Most of this news went un-noticed as the WannaCry vulnerability affected more mainstream people than those using cryptocurrencies. This attack shuts down SMB networking to prevent further infections and enrolls in an Adylkuzz mining botnet. 

Adylkuzz is being used to mine Monero, which is similar to Bitcoin. It is believed that because Adylkuzz removes all other infections, that it might have mitigated most of the actual WannaCry vulnerabilities and kept the attack smaller than it could have been.

Since the WannaCry vulnerability made headlines, others have noticed the same vulnerabilities. Samba recently patched a vulnerability which existed on all versions. Sasmba is used for SMB and CIFS services for Linux systems. The risks of WannaCry could exploit this SMB and spread across the network.

I will update this post with more information.-->
