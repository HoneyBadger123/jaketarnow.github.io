title: Quick Background
---

I am currently at the [University of San Francisco](https://www.usfca.edu/arts-sciences/graduate-programs/computer-science) pursuing my Masterâ€™s Degree in Computer Science. While a full-time student, I am also a part-time Developer at [Acxiom](http://www.acxiom.com/). I have held various roles in the tech industry since graduating from [Marquette University](http://www.marquette.edu/) in May 2013. I have worked for a start-up working closely with iOS developers, data scientists, and learning how to problem solve bugs in a simple and precise way. I have rebuilt the website for a publishing company, which exponentially increased viewership, and currently work for [Acxiom](http://www.acxiom.com/) where I write JavaScript parsing applications and programs for Fortune 500 companies.

Honestly, Computer Science was not my plan entering college as an undergrad. I went to [Marquette University](http://www.marquette.edu/) because they offered an electronic communication degree that I sought in order to learn sound design and multimedia. My undergrad curriculum at Marquette provided the opportunity to learn new skills and develop my creative and leadership roles in those interests. As my classes became more involved and I was opening up more and more to technology, my interest moved toward web development. I saw the many opportunities that software development and engineering provided, and wanted to expand my learning in that area. It was in teaching myself programming languages and researching school jobs that I found the Student Media Department. During this time, I added a minor in Information Technology to my degree as my interest for computer science kept growing. This program introduced me to programming, database management, systems analysis and design, and web apps. 

Since my undergraduate studies, I found software development and started to fall in love with computer science. Once working at [GAIN Fitness](https://gainfitness.com/), I was able to see software engineering in action. Starting from diagrams and problems on a white board to opening an app on my phone. From there I knew I wanted to pursue Computer Science, and make software engineering a career decision. I believe that through the MSCS program at USF, I will be able to grow as a software engineer and broaden my horizons through the valuable coursework and opportunities that USF offers through the program. I truly have the desire to learn as much as possible and to reach my goals in computer science. 

So much for a quick rundown of my background and experiences.  Now for the fun stuff: examples of the many projects/challenges that I face through graduate school and the industry. Stay tuned!
