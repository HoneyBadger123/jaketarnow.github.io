My name is Jake Tarnow and I'm a graduate student at University of San Francisco working towards my Master's in Computer Science. I will be graduating in May 2017 and am actively looking for a new position in the field of software engineer and security. I have a passion for security, networking, and all things crypto. I believe my non-traditional background and education bring a new perspective to the industry and field. I am constantly reading and learning new technologies and trends that allow me to grow through challenges and aid in team devlopment. Feel free to message me on any of my social platforms if you are interested or talking or want to check out my CV!
