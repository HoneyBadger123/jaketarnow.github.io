# Computer Networking
*Diagnose Home WiFi via iOS Application*

### Directed Study with mentorship from Sami Rollins at USF

## Objective
To build an application that can decode all devices found on your wifi network and run diagnostics on their consumption of the network. Options include running a speed tests that will display (ping, download, and upload) speeds. With regards to the devices, there will be MAC Address decoding to see the human readable names of the devices such as "John's MacBook Pro". 

## Technologies
* Objective-C
* Swift
* AWS
* More?

## Tasks
* Find all devices on wifi. Display network address, name of device, and manufacturer (Decoding MAC Address)
* Scan active services such as HTTP, SMS, FTP, DNS
* Identify the hops to reach a specific destination. Important to follow where the packets go
* Meause network performance. Basic speed test of the network. Measure the round-trip for packets sent to a destination host. Testing of ping, download, and upload. 
* With all of the above in mind, diagnose the network and how it runs throughout the day and common devices that are on the network...(time frame per device, how much usage it is conducting, how the various devices interact with each other)
* Possibly suggest ways to optimize your home network

## Tentative Schedule *Meeting Weekly*
Throughout this project, I will be referring to *Computer Networking: A Top-Down Approach (7th Edition)* as a guide to all things computer networking and networking protocols.
* Week 1: (Aug 29 - Sept 3) - Create page/wiki and determine a rough set of tasts and objectives for the project. Continue with research on networking and systems.
* Week 2: (Sept 4 - Sept 10) - Continue research on networking protocols and introduction to Objective-C and Swift
* Week 3: (Sept 11 - Sept 17) - Build test application to connect to a wifi network and verify connection
* Week 4: (Sept 18 - Sept 24) - Iterate on application and clean up connections and bugs
* Week 5: (Sept 25 - Oct 1) - 
* Week 6: (Oct 2 - Oct 8)
* Week 7: (Oct 9 - Oct 15)
* Week 8: (Oct 16 - Oct 22)
